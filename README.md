# TypeScript advanced lab
## Purpose 
So you wanna dive deeper into TypeScript? Letâ€™s try to make a simple eCommerce website! It can be for anything, maybe a furniture store, simple food store or a clothing store. We will need sections of items and a cart. 
During PGP we try to guide you, but not guide you as closely as in the course. We are here to help you get started and then you can decide on your own the way you wanna go! So this lab is more of a simple set-up for you to get started. And it is up to you how you want to continue.
This is a full stack app. So you will of course need your frontend using TypeScript and a fitting backend connected to your database (this stores the products).
## Lab
An eCommerce website needs a few simple requirements to get started: 
## A cart
the user should be able to add to the cart 
view their products
See the total price
remove products 
cart be saved in local storage or database
## Multiple sections of products 
To start off with a few sections that are dropdowns. As you click on a section it will show a drop-down of the products. And the user can add these products to their cart
## The products themselves 
Price
An image 
And you can also show the current stock
Checkout your cart
When user is done they can click on pay, and products will be deducted from the database






# ReadMe By Next JS
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
